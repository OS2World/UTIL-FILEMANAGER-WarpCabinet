Warp Cabinet by Richard Dragan

PURPOSE:

        Warp Cabinet is an OS/2 Warp file management utility that is
easier to use than the Drives tool included with OS/2. Its interface
is similar to the Windows 3.1 File Manager, but it can display multiple
drives in a single window like the Windows 95 Explorer.

USAGE:

       To install Warp Cabinet, copy the files WARPCAB.EXE and 
WARPCAB.INI to a directory on your hard disk. The directory need not be
in your path, but both files must be in the same directory. Then add an
icon for Warp Cabinet to your OS/2 desktop.

       When you launch Warp Cabinet, you'll see a dual pane window. Your installed drives and directories appear in the All Folders list in the
left pane. The contents of the highlighted folder is displayed in the
right pane.

       You can move selected files by dragging them to the desired folder
in the left pane and dropping them. To copy files, hold down the Control
key when dragging and dropping the file. You can also move and copy 
files through menu options.

       To print a text file, drag it to the OS/2 Printer icon and drop
it. Double click on an executable to run it; double click on a document
file to open it within the program that manages it. Menu items let you
set up additional associations, change file attributes, customize the
file display, and other options.
